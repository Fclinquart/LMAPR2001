function, functional unit, and reference flow of your analysis. Discuss your choices with your
mentor to make sure that you start in the right direction.
2. Create a flowsheet of the fabrication, use, and end-of-life of your technology, starting from
raw materials and including the main processing steps with a possible scenario for the end-of-
life (can you recover some energy, matter, or not ? Will you recycle, trash or burn the waste
?). This will require you to identify the main processing operations that lead to the different
components of your technology. In this phase, it is very important that you define properly
the boundaries of your analysis as explained in the seminar/tutorial. Discuss your choices with
your mentor.
