**Write a program to compute the optical transmission and reflection by
multilayered structures for any angle of incidence, and use it to explore how it is possible to transmit as much light as possible in the visible range while reflecting the rest of the solar spectrum.**
- Section 4.6 of the book of Azzam and Bashara
1.  performance of your optimal window compared to bare glass or the simple metal film on glass for normal incidence.
2. Find optimal values for the thickness of each layer for the case of normal incidence,
3. What is the physical reason a trilayer behaves better than a single layer

# Section 2

**How much solar power is reflected by your windows compared to
bare glass, and thereby estimate the electricity you will spare for air-conditioning.**
